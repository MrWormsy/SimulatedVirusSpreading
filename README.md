# VirusSpreadingSimulation
We want to simulate the way a virus spread in a 2D world where some people know each other.

## If you want to run it without args it will run an exemple where N=5000, M=25, F=10, T=10 & V=25
And it will display a run with this configuration

## To run in with arguments you need to use : java -jar SimulatedVirusSpreading.jar M N F V T

Where:

M : The radius inside the people get have a relation

N : The size of the map

F : The max number of relation a given person can have in the radius M

V : The number of vaccine given each day

T : The day the virus is given to the population



#### example : java -jar SimulatedVirusSpreading.jar 20 10000 10 25 10
